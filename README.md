An extendable store for WonderCMS

This plugin allows for a store in wondercms.

It registers itself under yourdomain.com/wondercms/**store/\***

Edit the `simplestore.json` to add products (for now)

You can add a product card to any page using its embed tag: `[product sku=KB-TEE]`

Payment methods are supplied by different plugins. Check out StephanStanisic/simplestore-free for a simple all orders are automaticly paid example.

This whole project needs a lot of polishing up.
